<p> <div id="foo_restat" style="display:none"> <div align="justify">This paper studies peer effects in the adoption of a Youth Employment Subsidy in Chile since its inception. We study the effects that former classmates' and coworkers' adoption has on one's adoption. Identification comes from discontinuities in the assignment rule that allow us to construct valid instrumental variables for peers' adoption. Using a comprehensive set of administrative records, we find that classmates and, especially, coworkers play a significant role in the adoption of the subsidy. Peer effects are determined during the early stages of the program's implementation and vary by network characteristics and the strength of network ties.</div></div></p>

<p> <div id="foo_fop" style="display:none"> <div align="justify">Recently, front-of-package (FOP) food labeling systems have captured the attention of researchers and policy makers. Several Latin American governments are currently considering employing different FOP labeling systems. However, there is much need for more research-based evidence in these countries. In this paper, we study whether the immediate food-purchasing decision and the nutritional quality of the purchase are influenced by randomly informing some customers and not others about an FOP label known as Nutri-Score. We also separate the information effect from the effect of being aware of the system. We combined a randomized field intervention in a university cafeteria in Bogotá, Colombia with data from an after-purchase survey and receipts. We found that randomly providing information on Nutri-Score increased total expenditure by $0.18. Additional spending on healthier items was 21% or $0.26 higher, with no change for less healthy items. Expenditure estimates were higher among customers aware of the system’s existence. Treated customers were also 10% more likely to buy a healthier item than control customers were, and the concentration of protein of their purchases was greater. Information on the Nutri-Score system increased the store’s sales. This potential financial incentive may ease implementation of Nutri-Score.</div></div></p>
