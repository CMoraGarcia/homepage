This paper studies peer effects in the adoption of a Youth Employment Subsidy in Chile since its inception. We study the effects that former classmates' and coworkers' adoption has on one's adoption. Identification comes from discontinuities in the assignment rule that allow us to construct valid instrumental variables for peers' adoption. Using a comprehensive set of administrative records, we find that classmates and, especially, coworkers play a significant role in the adoption of the subsidy. Peer effects are determined during the early stages of the program's implementation and vary by network characteristics and the strength of network ties.
