<p> <div id="foo_restat" style="display:none"> <div align="justify">This paper studies peer effects in the adoption of a Youth Employment Subsidy in Chile since its inception. We study the effects that former classmates' and coworkers' adoption has on one's adoption. Identification comes from discontinuities in the assignment rule that allow us to construct valid instrumental variables for peers' adoption. Using a comprehensive set of administrative records, we find that classmates and, especially, coworkers play a significant role in the adoption of the subsidy. Peer effects are determined during the early stages of the program's implementation and vary by network characteristics and the strength of network ties.</div></div></p>

<p> <div id="foo_fop" style="display:none"> <div align="justify">Recently, front-of-package (FOP) food labeling systems have captured the attention of researchers and policy makers. Several Latin American governments are currently considering employing different FOP labeling systems. However, there is much need for more research-based evidence in these countries. In this paper, we study whether the immediate food-purchasing decision and the nutritional quality of the purchase are influenced by randomly informing some customers and not others about an FOP label known as Nutri-Score. We also separate the information effect from the effect of being aware of the system. We combined a randomized field intervention in a university cafeteria in Bogotá, Colombia with data from an after-purchase survey and receipts. We found that randomly providing information on Nutri-Score increased total expenditure by $0.18. Additional spending on healthier items was 21% or $0.26 higher, with no change for less healthy items. Expenditure estimates were higher among customers aware of the system’s existence. Treated customers were also 10% more likely to buy a healthier item than control customers were, and the concentration of protein of their purchases was greater. Information on the Nutri-Score system increased the store’s sales. This potential financial incentive may ease implementation of Nutri-Score.</div></div></p>

3. [Can Benefits from Malaria Eradication be Increased? Evidence from Costa Rica](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/695880)<br />
_Economic Development and Cultural Change, Vol. 66, No. 3, pp. 585-628, April 2018_<br />
<a href="javascript:void();" onclick="toggle_visibility('foo_edcc');"> [abstract]</a>

<p> <div id="foo_edcc" style="display:none"> <div align="justify">The estimated benefits of malaria eradication have been very different in terms of human capital accumulation. This paper quantifies the impact of malaria eradication in Costa Rica and explores whether pre-campaign regional characteristics can improve or damage the benefits of a health campaign. There are several results. First, using difference in differences I find that years of education of men and women increased in response to the eradication campaign but that only wages of males increased. Results are robust. Second, worse conditions in the school system and more child employment displaced schooling. Hence, health benefits may not translate into educational gains when the school system characteristics are bad or when the child labor market provides a better investment opportunity than schooling. Third, combining empirical evidence with a simple model, the increase in schooling cannot solely explain the increase in the income of men; however, health improvements explain most of the increase. Finally, the point estimates show that human capital gains were almost completely eliminated when a shortage of funding for eradication led to a resurgence of malaria; this emphasizes the fragility of the estimated benefits.</div></div></p>

<p> <div id="foo_phc" style="display:none"> <div align="justify">Despite its importance in health system planning, the contribution of primary health care (PHC) is difficult to evaluate, especially in low and middle-income countries. This paper uses variation in the timing of implementation of the 1995 Costa Rican primary health care (PHC) reform to examine its long- term effect on mortality. We find that within eleven years after opening a Health Area, age-adjusted mortality rates significantly decreased by 9 percent. The effect is higher among adults older than 65 years and in cardiovascular-related causes of death, especially among clinics not managed by the government. A potential mechanism is better access to health services. These results highlight that the pursuit of universal health care by strengthening PHC can have long-lasting and significant effects on mortality.</div></div></p>
